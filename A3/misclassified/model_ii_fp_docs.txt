FP 92 (Confidence: 2.3638):
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .

FP 93 (Confidence: 2.3634):
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .

FP 94 (Confidence: 2.3531):
