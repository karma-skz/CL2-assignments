======================================================================

FN 1 (Confidence: 13.3665):
neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway .

FN 2 (Confidence: 10.0369):
remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it .

FN 3 (Confidence: 8.0340):
i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind .

FN 4 (Confidence: 7.7694):

i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow .

FN 6 (Confidence: 7.3314):
its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .

FN 7 (Confidence: 7.2225):
it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .

FN 8 (Confidence: 6.4231):
as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good .

FN 9 (Confidence: 6.0525):
the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing .

while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio .

FN 13 (Confidence: 5.3118):
it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .

FN 14 (Confidence: 5.2942):
none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere .

FN 15 (Confidence: 5.2935):
once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera . . .

FN 16 (Confidence: 5.2106):
if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x .

FN 17 (Confidence: 5.1267):

while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original .

FN 19 (Confidence: 5.0079):
" austin powers in goldmember " has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end .

thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer .

FN 26 (Confidence: 4.3067):
despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script .

FN 27 (Confidence: 4.3010):
it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .

FN 28 (Confidence: 4.2667):
goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .

FN 29 (Confidence: 4.2554):
this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative .

FN 30 (Confidence: 4.2498):
the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain .

FN 31 (Confidence: 4.1730):
you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .

FN 32 (Confidence: 4.0102):

FN 33 (Confidence: 3.9696):
director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question .

perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .

FN 36 (Confidence: 3.8833):
whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time .

FN 37 (Confidence: 3.8810):
byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground .

FN 38 (Confidence: 3.7848):
this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters .

a " black austin powers ? " i prefer to think of it as " pootie tang with a budget . " sa da tay !

FN 45 (Confidence: 3.6104):

FN 46 (Confidence: 3.5104):
there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall .

FN 47 (Confidence: 3.4774):

FN 48 (Confidence: 3.4581):
it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count .

FN 50 (Confidence: 3.4328):
never [sinks] into exploitation .

FN 51 (Confidence: 3.4302):

FN 55 (Confidence: 3.2424):
another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .

FN 56 (Confidence: 3.2337):
scooby doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .

FN 57 (Confidence: 3.1861):
not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .

FN 58 (Confidence: 3.1849):
if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic .

FN 59 (Confidence: 3.1797):
the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold .

FN 60 (Confidence: 3.1716):
whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like .

FN 61 (Confidence: 3.0620):
maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad .

FN 62 (Confidence: 3.0349):
. . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor .

FN 63 (Confidence: 3.0309):
as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits .

FN 64 (Confidence: 3.0094):
like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .

FN 65 (Confidence: 2.9955):
the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact .

FN 66 (Confidence: 2.9851):
awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .

FN 67 (Confidence: 2.9020):
it may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied .

FN 68 (Confidence: 2.8807):
a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps .

far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series .

FN 72 (Confidence: 2.7778):
blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .

FN 73 (Confidence: 2.7627):

steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it .

FN 78 (Confidence: 2.6181):
. . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun .

FN 79 (Confidence: 2.6122):
the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .

FN 80 (Confidence: 2.5720):
it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?

FN 85 (Confidence: 2.4754):
it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters .

FN 86 (Confidence: 2.4715):
while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort .

FN 87 (Confidence: 2.4602):
deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film .

FN 88 (Confidence: 2.4520):
it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out .

FN 89 (Confidence: 2.4512):
the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of .

FN 90 (Confidence: 2.4417):

FN 91 (Confidence: 2.4380):
idiotic and ugly .

FN 92 (Confidence: 2.4353):
more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent .

FN 93 (Confidence: 2.4341):
predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell .

FN 94 (Confidence: 2.4194):

FN 95 (Confidence: 2.4120):
no , it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original , but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels .

FN 96 (Confidence: 2.4066):

FN 98 (Confidence: 2.3819):
like a poor man's you can count on me

FN 99 (Confidence: 2.3041):
one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others .

FN 100 (Confidence: 2.3027):
it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out .

FN 101 (Confidence: 2.2897):
[allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise .

FN 102 (Confidence: 2.2888):

FN 104 (Confidence: 2.2520):

FN 108 (Confidence: 2.2333):

FN 110 (Confidence: 2.2148):
sleek and arty .

FN 111 (Confidence: 2.2074):
the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand .
