FN 5 (Confidence: 7.4454):

FN 6 (Confidence: 7.2964):
its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .

FN 19 (Confidence: 4.9231):
you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .

perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .

FN 25 (Confidence: 4.3638):

FN 42 (Confidence: 3.7796):

as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits .

FN 63 (Confidence: 3.1979):
. . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun .

FN 64 (Confidence: 3.1502):

awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .

FN 70 (Confidence: 2.9922):

far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series .

FN 80 (Confidence: 2.6697):
whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like .

it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . .

FN 92 (Confidence: 2.5512):
all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon .

FN 93 (Confidence: 2.5447):
