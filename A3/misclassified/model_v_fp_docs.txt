FP 2 (Confidence: 6.8918):
jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .

FP 9 (Confidence: 5.4779):
city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .

the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .

FP 12 (Confidence: 5.0392):
a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that .

FP 13 (Confidence: 4.9075):

FP 19 (Confidence: 4.2258):

the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .

FP 28 (Confidence: 3.8959):
the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .

FP 31 (Confidence: 3.6159):

FP 32 (Confidence: 3.5171):

FP 36 (Confidence: 3.4265):
sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?

FP 58 (Confidence: 2.6558):
watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .

FP 59 (Confidence: 2.6071):
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .

FP 60 (Confidence: 2.6010):
i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking .

FP 69 (Confidence: 2.4490):
. . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks .

FP 70 (Confidence: 2.4330):

FP 71 (Confidence: 2.4264):
a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .

FP 72 (Confidence: 2.4056):

involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .

the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design .

FP 76 (Confidence: 2.3437):
far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .

FP 77 (Confidence: 2.3188):
no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show .

a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .

FP 79 (Confidence: 2.2935):
unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .

FP 80 (Confidence: 2.2710):
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .

FP 81 (Confidence: 2.2440):
hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .

FP 82 (Confidence: 2.1856):

FP 85 (Confidence: 2.1423):
observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom .

FP 86 (Confidence: 2.1414):

kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .

FP 90 (Confidence: 2.1124):
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .

FP 91 (Confidence: 2.0967):
i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .

FP 92 (Confidence: 2.0851):
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt .

FP 93 (Confidence: 2.0654):
all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .

FP 94 (Confidence: 2.0636):
as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up .

FP 95 (Confidence: 2.0566):
it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .

FP 96 (Confidence: 2.0416):
eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . .

FP 97 (Confidence: 2.0364):
starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches .

FP 98 (Confidence: 2.0168):
always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .

FP 99 (Confidence: 2.0091):
puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face .

FP 100 (Confidence: 2.0080):
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .

FP 101 (Confidence: 2.0079):
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls .

FP 102 (Confidence: 2.0062):
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .

FP 103 (Confidence: 2.0019):
although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .
