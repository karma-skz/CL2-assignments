TRUE NEGATIVES (TN): Correctly Rejected as Non-Antecedent
Total: 0, Showing: 0
================================================================================

No True Negative cases found.

WHY NO TRUE NEGATIVES?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this coreference resolution task, we ALWAYS make exactly one prediction
per example (selecting the best-scoring candidate). We never predict 'NONE'.
Therefore:
  - A True Negative would require: predicting 'no antecedent' when there
    actually is no antecedent.
  - Since we always predict a candidate, we can never have TN = 0.
  - Every prediction is either TP (correct) or FP (wrong candidate chosen).
  - Every case is either TP (correct) or FN (missed correct candidate).
