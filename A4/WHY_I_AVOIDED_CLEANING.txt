lowercasing everything would lead to loss of capitalisation ie loss of proper nouns (that have the first letter capitalised!) for a standard POS tagger

removing punctuation would mean removing cues that tell about sentence separation and making things difficult for POS tagging!

removing stopwords would break chunking and degrade a pretrained POS tagger because it would remove most aux verbs

stemming/lemmatizing makes words lose implicit number/tense markers like running can be written as "run(list all tenses possible)" but it would be difficult for a pretrained POS tagger to work with data like that.

didnt remove extra white spaces because in the test and train sets there are no unneeded line breaks and there is only 1 instance of more than 1 space occuring continuously. its not worth cleaning because of this.


the main reason is that changing the data would mean that the given offsets would have to be rechecked.
