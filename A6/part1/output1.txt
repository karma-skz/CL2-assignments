Target Word: 'keep' (POS: VB)
Gold Sense: keep%2:42:07::
Context (±5 words): ['the', 'continue', 'keep', 'will', 'review', 'committee', 'situation', 'relating', 'to', 'under']...

  keep.v.01:
    Definition: keep in a certain state, position, or activity; e.g.,
    Overlap: 2 words
    Common: ['the', 'keep']

  continue.v.01:
    Definition: continue a certain state, condition, or activity
    Overlap: 4 words
    Common: ['to', 'the', 'keep', 'continue']

  keep.v.03:
    Definition: retain possession of
    Overlap: 1 words
    Common: ['keep']

  prevent.v.02:
    Definition: stop (someone or something) from doing something or being in a certain state
    Overlap: 2 words
    Common: ['the', 'keep']

  observe.v.09:
    Definition: conform one's action or practice to
    Overlap: 3 words
