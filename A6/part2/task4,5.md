# Cross Linguistic Patterns in Argument Structure Across English and Hindi

This document summarizes the major patterns observed in argument structure when comparing English sentences with their Hindi translations. The focus is on how PropBank roles (ARG0 to ARG4), FrameNet roles (Agent, Experiencer, Goal, Theme, Manner, Source, Location, Patient, Time), and predicate positions behave across the two languages.

## 1. PropBank Argument Role Patterns

### 1.1 ARG0 (Agent or Doer)

In English, the agent often appears at the beginning of the sentence. Even when the sentence starts with an adjunct like "Within this setting," the agent still appears early. In Hindi, ARG0 also appears early but can follow initial adjuncts. The surface order is different, but the semantic mapping is consistent.

### 1.2 ARG1 (Theme or Patient)

In English, ARG1 typically appears right after the verb or as a clausal complement. In Hindi, ARG1 comes before the verb due to the SOV structure. Hindi often expresses clausal complements using "ki" clauses.

### 1.3 ARG2, ARG3, ARG4 (Recipient, Goal, Source, Direction, Instrument)

English expresses these roles with prepositions such as "to," "for," and "by." Hindi uses postpositions like "ko," "se," and "par." Even though word order differs, the semantic roles map cleanly across languages.

### 1.4 Clausal ARG1 Patterns

Both languages frequently use entire clauses as ARG1, especially with mental verbs such as "see" and "feel." English places the clause after the verb, while Hindi places it before the verb.

## 2. FrameNet Role Patterns

### 2.1 Agent

The agent is normally the subject in English. In Hindi, the agent is often marked with "ne." The structural positioning may differ, but the semantic role remains equivalent.

### 2.2 Patient or Theme

English places the patient after the verb or inside a prepositional phrase. Hindi places it directly before the final verb complex.

### 2.3 Experiencer

English uses subject experiencers with mental verbs. Hindi uses a dative experiencer marked with "ko," which is a major structural difference.

### 2.4 Goal

English often expresses goals with prepositions like "to" and "towards." Hindi expresses the same using postpositions such as "ko" or "ke liye."

### 2.5 Source

English expresses source with prepositions like "by." Hindi uses forms like "ke dvaara," though it may be omitted depending on context.

### 2.6 Manner

Both languages use subordinate clauses or adverbial phrases to express manner, although Hindi places them earlier in the sentence.

### 2.7 Time

Temporal phrases appear in flexible positions in both languages. Hindi frequently places them at the beginning.

### 2.8 Location

Location is expressed similarly in both languages, but Hindi again prefers placing the phrase earlier.

## 3. Predicate Position

### 3.1 English Predicate Position

English uses an SVO order. Verbs appear early in the sentence, followed by complements. Passive constructions use forms of "be" with a past participle.

### 3.2 Hindi Predicate Position

Hindi is consistently SOV. The verb complex appears at the end of the sentence and may include a lexical verb, a light verb, aspect markers, and auxiliaries. The predicate is usually longer and more layered than in English.

### 3.3 Effect on Argument Placement

Because English places the verb early, arguments expand after the predicate. Hindi places arguments before the predicate. Despite the shift in order, the underlying semantic role assignments remain stable.

## 4. Patterns Observed in the Given Sentences

### 4.1 Frequent Clausal Objects

Many sentences contain clausal objects serving as ARG1. English uses complement clauses that follow the verb. Hindi uses "ki" clauses that appear before the final verb.

### 4.2 Light Verb Usage in Hindi

Hindi uses light verbs such as "kiya," "diya," "gaya," and "jaa tia hai" to build complex predicate structures.

### 4.3 Experiencer Constructions

English employs subject experiencers. Hindi uses dative experiencers, which changes the surface syntax but not the semantics.

### 4.4 Passive Constructions

English passives use forms like "was hired." Hindi uses forms like "kiya gaya." The agent is often omitted in Hindi, and the patient becomes the subject.

### 4.5 Adjunct Positioning

Both languages allow flexible adjunct placement. Hindi shows a stronger preference for placing time, manner, and location phrases early in the sentence.

| Feature      | English                     | Hindi                        | Overall Pattern                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic order  | SVO                         | SOV                          | Predicate appears early in English and final in Hindi |
| ARG0         | Subject                     | Often marked with "ne"       | Similar semantic role with different surface position |
| ARG1         | After verb                  | Before verb                  | Consistent mapping with different syntactic positions |
| ARG2 to ARG4 | Expressed with prepositions | Expressed with postpositions | Roles map closely semantically                        |
| Experiencer  | Subject                     | Marked with "ko"             | Major structural difference                           |
| Adjuncts     | Flexible positioning        | Often appear early           | Hindi favors early placement                          |
| Passive      | "be" plus participle        | Light verb plus "gaya"       | Role mapping stays consistent                         |
| Predicate    | Appears early               | Appears at end               | Affects where arguments are placed                    |

This analysis shows that although English and Hindi differ significantly in surface word order, the underlying semantic roles are stable across both languages. The main point of variation is the syntactic realization of these roles, shaped by SVO in English and SOV in Hindi.

# Linguistic and Structural Challenges and Cross Lingual Variations

## Linguistic or Structural Challenges

### Mismatch Between SVO and SOV Word Order

English usually places the verb early in the sentence and follows a subject verb object order. Hindi places the verb complex at the end with all major arguments appearing before it. This naturally creates difficulties when trying to align argument structures across the two languages.

### Complex Hindi Verb Clusters

Hindi predicates often contain a lexical verb along with one or more light verbs, aspect markers, and auxiliaries. This makes the predicate longer and harder to isolate, especially when compared to the simpler verb structures in English.

### Prepositions vs Postpositions

English expresses core relations using prepositions such as "to," "for," "with," and "by." Hindi uses postpositions like "ko," "se," and "ke liye." Even when the semantic role matches, the syntactic marking differs, making direct comparison less straightforward.

### Loss or Addition of Information During Translation

During translation between English and Hindi, some details may be condensed or expanded. Hindi often uses light verb constructions or participial forms that compress meaning, which can make one to one structural alignment more difficult.

## Interesting Cross Lingual Variations

### Hindi Light Verbs Add Semantics Not Present in English

Hindi makes frequent use of light verbs such as "diya," "liya," and "gaya," which add nuances like completion, intensity, or passivity. These nuances do not appear in English in the same structural way, leading to richer predicate meanings in Hindi.

### Passive Agents Often Omitted in Hindi

English passives can include optional "by" phrases to express the agent. Hindi passives commonly omit the agent entirely, promoting the patient to the subject position and altering how core roles like ARG0 and AGENT surface.

### Alignment of FrameNet Roles Remains Stable

Despite differences in syntax and morphology, semantic roles such as Agent, Patient, Theme, Goal, and Location tend to map consistently across English and Hindi. The structure may shift, but the underlying meaning remains aligned.
